# Pomodoro

## Introduction
A small static application to maintain daily routine. 

The **Pomodoro Technique** is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.[1] It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, 
separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student

The application bassically starts a 25 minute timer once an apple is clicked followed by a 5 minute break timer.
